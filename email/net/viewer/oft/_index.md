    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Email for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.Email is a Microsoft Outlook and Thunderbird formats parsing solution. One can easily create, manipulate, convert email and storage formats such as MSG, EMLX, EML and MHT. Handling of email attachments, customization of message headers and implementation of different network protocols like POP3, IMAP & SMTP to send & receive emails is much easier. Its a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Outlook or any other software installation. ‎

Files with .OFT extension represent message template files that are created using Microsoft Outlook. The pre-formatted layout set for message templates is then used for sending out emails with common information to save time. Such files can be generated by creating a new email, adding necessary information and then using the Save As Office Template (*.oft) dropdown from Microsoft Outlook. Users can open the OFT files by double clicking on it and it will open in associated application on that particular system.
