 Email API is a Microsoft Outlook and Thunderbird formats parsing solution. One can easily create, manipulate, convert email and storage formats such as MSG, EMLX, EML and MHT. Handling of email attachments, customization of message headers and implementation of different network protocols like POP3, IMAP & SMTP to send & receive emails is much easier. Its a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Outlook or any other software installation.

EML file format represents email messages saved using Outlook and other relevant applications. Almost all emailing clients support this file format for its compliance with RFC-822 Internet Message Format Standard. Microsoft Outlook is the default software for opening EML message types. EML files can be used for saving to disc as well as sending out to recipients using communication protocols.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMLX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/email/emlx/" >}}

The EMLX file format is implemented and developed by Apple. The Apple Mail application uses the EMLX file format for exporting the emails. There are other applications as well that can open the EMLX files and convert these to other file formats.
