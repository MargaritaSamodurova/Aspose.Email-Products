 Aspose.Email is a Microsoft Outlook and Thunderbird formats parsing solution. One can easily create, manipulate, convert email and storage formats such as MSG, EMLX, EML and MHT. Handling of email attachments, customization of message headers and implementation of different network protocols like POP3, IMAP & SMTP to send & receive emails is much easier. Its a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Outlook or any other software installation.

VCF (Virtual Card Format) or vCard is a digital file format for storing contact information. The format is widely used for data interchange among popular information exchange applications. Most operating systems such as Windows and MacOS come with default applications to create and open these files. A single VCF file can contain contact information for one or multiple contacts. A VCF file usually contains information such as contact's name, address, phone number, email, birthday, photographs and audio in addition to a number of other fields. Being supported by email clients and services, there is no loss of data during the transfer of contacts via using the vCard format. The media type for VCF file format is text/vcard.

Files with .OFT extension represent message template files that are created using Microsoft Outlook. The pre-formatted layout set for message templates is then used for sending out emails with common information to save time. Such files can be generated by creating a new email, adding necessary information and then using the Save As Office Template (*.oft) dropdown from Microsoft Outlook. Users can open the OFT files by double clicking on it and it will open in associated application on that particular system.
