EML file format represents email messages saved using Outlook and other relevant applications. Almost all emailing clients support this file format for its compliance with RFC-822 Internet Message Format Standard. Microsoft Outlook is the default software for opening EML message types. EML files can be used for saving to disc as well as sending out to recipients using communication protocols.

Files with .OFT extension represent message template files that are created using Microsoft Outlook. The pre-formatted layout set for message templates is then used for sending out emails with common information to save time.
