 Aspose.Email is a Microsoft Outlook and Thunderbird formats parsing solution. One can easily create, manipulate, convert email and storage formats such as MSG, EMLX, EML and MHT. Handling of email attachments, customization of message headers and implementation of different network protocols like POP3, IMAP & SMTP to send & receive emails is much easier. Its a standalone API and does not require Microsoft Outlook or any other software installation.

OST or Offline Storage Files represent user's mailbox data in offline mode on local machine upon registration with Exchange Server using Microsoft Outlook. It is automatically created on the first use of Microsoft Outlook upon connectivity with server. Once the file is created, the data is synchronized with the email server so that it is available offline as well in case of disconnectivity from email server. OST files can user mailbox items such as emails, contacts, calendar information, notes, tasks and other similar data. Users can create emails and other data items in OST file even in the absence of connection to the server, but these will not be synchronized with the server. Once the connection is established, the local file is synchronized with the server again so that both the server and the local copy are at the same level of information.
